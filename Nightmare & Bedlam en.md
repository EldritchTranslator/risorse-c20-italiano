Nightmare & Bedlam 

Undoing isn’t inevitable in a changeling’s life, though some other fates make it almost appealing by comparison. On the other end of the scale sits Bedlam: the loss of all humanity and mundanity, as a changeling’s fae nature supersedes the mortal one. While it isn’t as common as Undoing, it’s just as tragic. Nightmare and Imbalance accumulate slowly over time, much like Banality, but thankfully, there are ways to combat them before it becomes too much to bear. Of course, the more in tune a changeling is with her fae half, the harder it is to hide. While mortals with more vivid imaginations may be willing to accept that someone has inexplicable, magical qualities, those that insist such things can’t exist are more likely to mistrust anyone displaying signs of their true nature. 

While a changeling dangerously close to Undoing may need an infusion of Glamour to bring them back from the edge, it’s significantly harder to bring someone beck from the cusp of Bedlam. A few tools and methods are rumored to exist, but even the hushed whispers about them are deeply unpleasant, if not unthinkable. 

Nightmare 

Nightmare is as much a part of a changeling’s being as the fae nature that powers her magic. The only way to avoid accumulating it is by denying her magic entirely, which tends to spell the certain death of her fae self. While Nightmare isn’t actively harmful to her, it clues others into her true nature. Observers may not recognize precisely what she is, but they can tell there’s something off about her. Though the Mists erase the specifics of any unusual encounters, enough exposure to magic — particularly from the same changeling — can make even the most Banal and unbelieving mortal wary and suspicious.

Inevitability 

Taking on Nightmare is inevitable for a changeling. Despite its name, Nightmare isn’t necessarily harmful, or even particularly serious if carefully monitored. It can boost a changeling’s abilities in a tense moment, but tapping into Nightmare — part of the mythical origin of a changeling’s fae soul — has a tendency to perpetuate itself. The more a changeling expands her knowledge and uses her powers of magic, the more Nightmare she accumulates, and the more apparent her unearthly nature becomes to casual observers. Because of Nightmare’s intrinsic tie to a changeling’s abilities and the way it proliferates the more she uses them, all changelings learn fairly quickly what its effects are and develop their own codes for if and when they’re willing to risk taking on more. Some embrace it, eager to take shovel on more while they manage the Imbalance it brings along, while others are more reserved in delving into their legacies. Nonetheless, every changeling experiences Nightmare at one time or another, and how they react to it says a great deal about how they view their new lives. 

Subtlety 

In terms of the first signs of a changeling’s drift toward their supernatural state, Nightmare doesn’t draw much attention to itself. It rears its head only when the changeling is doing something obviously inhuman: affecting the Autumn world around her, pulling the Dreaming forward, making a show of the fact she can do things beyond what most can comprehend. If she’s slid too far into Banality, using her abilities to remind herself of her life as a changeling can do wonders to aide her recovery. Cantrips don’t do quite as much on their own, but they do offer the opportunity for a changeling to reach within herself, bringing her fae self to the forefront again to empower her casting. Regaining access to her fae self this way is risky, but sometimes a necessary measure. It’s a little easier to pull someone from the brink of Undoing than it is to retrieve them from Bedlam. So long as she doesn’t make a habit of spiking herself into Nightmare, it’s a good way to explore her own history and remind herself not only of who she is, but how her kith informs herself. Even before she awakens and after she’s Undone, a changeling’s mortal self has a way of resembling her fae half, and the lens of the Dreaming, filtered through Nightmare, can be a useful learning tool. 

Persistence 

Nightmare alone isn’t enough to reveal a changeling’s nature to others; unless she’s Unleashing or casting Wyrd cantrips, high Nightmare isn’t so obvious that the Mists need to cover it up. All changelings learn to live with their Nightmare waxing and waning as they tap into their powers and feel their heritage surge, only to ebb again when all is said and done. While mortals may not notice a marked difference in a changeling as their Nightmare peaks and falls, other changelings can usually gauge where one of their own falls at most points in time. Changelings see each other’s chimerical selves more vividly when their Nightmare is elevated, while those unable to perceive the Dreaming chalk the odd feeling they get from that individual up to a foul mood or an off day. Depending on how eager a changeling is to explore her own story and how in tune she already is with whatever she’s accomplished in her previous fae lives, she may learn more about herself as her Nightmare builds. While some dive in to discover more about their pasts, most caution against such reckless practices. A hasty descent quickly turns into a slippery slope that’s difficult to recover from. 

Imbalance 

The further a changeling moves in pursuit of her magical self, the less humanity and mortal ties mean to her, and the more she’s consumed by the myths and trappings of her condition. Most make an effort to maintain balance, sacrificing a harvest of Glamour now and then in favor of retaining their humanity. The math is simple: the more a changeling lets his humanity slide, the more other mortals distrust him. Whether they assume it’s due to a mental illness, poor upbringing, or something else, mortals in particular can sense that there is something not quite the same about their companion. Other changelings can recognize the condition for what it is, and often do their best to bring their friends back into balance before things can go too far. However, not all changelings want to stay in the middle of the road. The prospect of being Undone is a terrifying one, as it represents a sort of living death – the body goes on, but without everything that made it magical and wonderful. This alone can scare some Kithain into embracing an excess of Glamour. The way they see it, the choice between returning to a mundane world or living forever somewhere magical is no choice at all. Sadly, the truth is not nearly so simple, or so kind. 

Toeing the Line 

Short of never casting a cantrip, there isn’t much a changeling can do to prevent her Nightmare from rising. By comparison, keeping her Imbalance in check is something easier to manage. A sacrifice of Glamour here for a bit of the mundane world there is all it takes. Most changelings find a line where they’re comfortable with their Imbalance. For some, that means ridding herself of it the moment her Nightmare rolls over; others are willing to let it get so far as halfway or even most of the way to Bedlam before they attempt to beat back its effects. 

The Tipping Point 

Once more than half a changeling’s Willpower is Imbalanced, he’s crossed the line into the beginnings of Bedlam. While he can step away from the precipice by reducing his Imbalance as normal, every point past the halfway mark draws him closer and closer to the point of no return. Though technically it isn’t any harder than usual to take that backward step than it was when he started, doing so gets further and further from his mind the more he recedes inward. The Dreaming calls to him more clearly than ever, a siren song to a world-weary soul and an enticing promise to a troubled heart. He begins to lose interest in his mortal attachments, finding less meaning in family gatherings and friendly get-togethers, instead chasing after the mystical promises laid out by Glamour. As the Imbalance deepens, he spends more time in freeholds, or chases ever more demanding paths to Epiphany, seeking to discover something he hasn’t felt before. He’s begun to unravel mysteries he never knew existed, and their appeal grows stronger the more he studies them; the myths and dreams that built his own existence whisper to him from afar, begging him to learn their secrets and speak truths that haven’t been uttered in ages. What he doesn’t see, of course, is that he’s giving up his own essence to pursue these truths. Or worse yet, he sees, but doesn’t care anymore. Uneasy Aura While Nightmare alone isn’t enough to tip mortals off, Imbalance starts to clue them in that something is decidedly wrong. Once a changeling is past the halfway point, mortals start to see him as decidedly something other. Whether or not he’s to the point of being effectively locked in his own head, he’s begun to pull the Dreaming into clearer focus for changelings and mortals alike. Though the Mists guard mortals from remembering supernatural events, any mortal that looks at a changeling getting too close to Bedlam immediately knows there is something dangerous about them. They get the distinct feeling that whatever they’re looking at isn’t human, a thought that’s unshakeable no matter how illogical it seems. Even other changelings are uneasy in the presence of one of their own too close to the edge. Bedlam Falling all the way into Bedlam isn’t exactly easy, especially as there are ways to mediate the Imbalance that paves the way. It takes either dire circumstances to prevent a changeling from centering herself, or a single-minded effort to drive herself there to accomplish a complete descent into Bedlam. Some newer changelings, especially those who haven’t yet found a supportive community, attempt such a dive. Usually they’re discovered by those who can help before it gets too far, but sometimes all the help in the world can’t stop a stubborn and particularly hopeless individual. Such cases are tragedies in changeling courts and communities; not only does it mean that someone was so miserable in their mortal life that they welcomed such an escape so wholly they’d be willing to give up everything they’d known, but that even a new community and friendlier circumstances weren’t enough to keep them with one foot on the ground. Forced March One of the rare occasions where Bedlam isn’t exactly a choice, a changeling sometimes slides to her inevitable end if Glamour is too scarce and she’s pressed to use magic. Whether there’s a war between struggling commoners and distant leaders, an influx of Thallain threatening the order of a changeling community, or simply a lack of Dreamers in an area, Glamour shortages make balance difficult. While some won’t be able to stave off the Banality, others will cling to every scrap of Glamour they can find. Unable to spare anything on keeping her Imbalance in check, she’s forced to fend for herself using the limited resources around her. Her priorities aren’t focused on keeping herself on in the middle of the road been Bedlam and Undoing; they’re split between keeping herself alive and unharmed, making sure she’s able to defend herself or protect others, and still prevent herself from incurring too much Banality. Every scrap of Glamour she can harvest from any of the five Paths or available dross goes toward preserving everyone around her for just another week, or day, or hour. Seelie or Unseelie, Ravaging becomes an attractive option. There will be more Dreamers, and there’s honor in protecting your own. Isn’t there? Slow Decline Sometimes a changeling’s path to Bedlam is the product of an attempt to hold on just a little longer, simply losing track of how long she’s been in a freehold, or failing to consider the long-term effects of casting large amounts of magic in a short period of time. In cases like these, a changeling’s path to Bedlam isn’t as rapid as others, which allows the Mists to safely insulate mortals from her, and for other changelings to get used to the incremental change. When such a changeling spends her time in a freehold, the shift may be more rapid and pronounced, but if she seats herself as its protector, getting her out is likely to be difficult, and getting her to pass on the mantle is likely to be even more so. As a changeling becomes more and more prone to Banality triggers, her temporary nature makes it easy to forget to be careful about when and how she exercises her will. Only in the deepest throes of Imbalance will it become clear just how far gone this changeling is, and by that point she’s unlikely to listen to anyone telling her she needs to pull back. The Dreaming is so close, and so, so inviting. Willful Abandon Sometimes there isn’t anything in the mortal world that can keep someone attached. Changelings in desperate situations see the Dreaming as a means of escape, a reality far better than the one they live in every day. Whether they haven’t found a changeling community to join or feel like an outsider in any ones they can find, they feel out of place enough that spending time straddling the space between mortal and fae isn’t comfortable. If they’re isolated, throwing themselves headlong into Glamour and its effects earns them the label of disturbed or unwell, often landing them in psychiatric wards or leaving them homeless. Those that escape into the Dreaming are sometimes considered the lucky ones, as they don’t have to struggle with mortal powers attempting to sedate them or cope with life on the street with the Dreaming pouring in from all sides. On the other hand, notions of an idyllic escape mask the fact that the Dreaming has dangers of its own, especially for desperate and inexperienced changelings. Those that have — or maybe had — a place in changeling society are more tragic figures, more likely to vanish off the Silver Path or beyond the borders of a freehold, never to be heard from again. Their friends, changeling and mortal alike, mourn their disappearance; most painfully, those who know what happened can’t relay it to the mortals questioning their loved one’s sudden change in temperament and subsequent disappearance. Lost Ones Occasionally, other changelings can stumble upon Bedlamites, especially ones who have locked themselves in freeholds for too long. These individuals pose a significant threat to other changelings. Lost in their own minds, unable to see the world right in front of them for all the splendor of the Dreaming that gets in the way, they’ll do anything to keep going. Capable of appearing alarmingly lucid, at least when dealing with changelings and Prodigals, most don’t realize how dangerous these unhinged beings are until the trap is already sprung. Whether they seek to imprison another to secure their own freedom, to ensnare someone to act as their servant, or to aim to pursue an agenda unknowable to anyone but themselves, they can wreak untold havoc and are extremely dangerous. He hadn’t meant to promise to help the thing that crawled from the shadows to beg. She’d asked him over and over again, until he’d finally said yes. Her haggard appearance and failing mind were all deception, he discovered, as the strings of Sovereign snapped into place when he agreed. The Hardest Part Fewer things are more difficult than confronting a changeling already lost to Bedlam. The world around them changes, drawing more of the Dreaming into focus, preventing changelings from easily blending in with the Autumn world and spooking mortals who prefer to keep their eyes firmly shut to such things. It’s hard to say which is worse for friends of lost changelings: saying goodbye, or trying to bring them back. Changelings lost to Bedlam forever can’t remain in the Autumn world. They attract too much attention, they disturb the lives of everyone around them, mortal and changeling alike, and they grow increasingly upset when they catch flashes of the Autumn world behind the Dreaming. Most do their best to remain in freeholds or close to other sources of Glamour, but sometimes even that isn’t enough, especially if other, more grounded changelings are present. Most find a thread of the Silver Path and, halfway to where they want to be, turn away from it. They spend the rest of their days wandering the Dreaming, leaving their old life behind and vanishing without a trace... or worse, returning as something alien to their old selves. Attempting to bring a lost changeling back is almost worse than saying goodbye. The only methods rumored to have some degree of effectiveness rely on exposing a changeling to some of the banes of the fae, surpassing the wellspring of Glamour around them and shocking their mortal mind back to the surface. Anyone practicing these procedures – some of the most delicate ever theorized – accepts that either they will succeed and bring their friend back, or, more likely, be responsible for their fae death and shoulder all the stigma this invites upon them. All the good intentions in the world can’t reduce the risks inherent to such actions. Nevertheless, there’s always someone foolish or doggedly determined enough to try. Cold Iron Cleansing Some say that the only way to burn off enough of the Dreaming’s hold on a Bedlamite is with the bane of Glamour and all fae kind: cold iron. Simply using a weapon made of it on a changeling doesn’t work to bring them back; whomever is attempting to save their friend has to attempt magic in its presence, blocking the Dreaming from infiltrating the Autumn world where the Bedlamite invites it. Spinning the essence of the iron into a kind of magical Faraday cage, the caster blocks off the influence of magic. Once the changeling is isolated from the Dreaming entirely, the real challenge begins: calling his mortal self back. Most attempt this with individuals or items from the Bedlamite’s past, anything that might be meaningful. Sometimes this isn’t an option — either any such sentimental figures are unreachable, or their loss of meaning led to the descent into Bedlam in the first place — and the changeling performing the cleansing has to improvise. Some attempt to connect empathetically, trying to call out to any scraps of mortality that might remain, but without a meaningful connection established before the Bedlamite’s descent, the patient is unlikely to listen. What follows is a grueling ordeal for both parties, as the Bedlamite faces the agony of cold iron while her friends and loved ones try to call her back to end her suffering. Autumnal Meditation Much less dangerous than a cold iron cleansing, a group of changelings — usually the Bedlamite’s motley — can work together to invoke the Autumn world around their lost friend in an attempt to insulate them from the Dreaming long enough to bring them back. Unfortunately, this is also most likely to simply drive the Bedlamite into a state of distress, as they can still see the Dreaming they’ve become accustomed to, but can’t interact with it in any meaningful way. This doesn’t disconnect them from the Glamour they attract; it merely holds back anything they attempt to do. Therefore, this sort of attempt is likely to provoke a Bedlamite to anger. The influx of Banality that follows invoking the Autumn world clashes violently with the Glamour surrounding the Bedlamite. Properly containing and targeting this Banality can bring the patient back to their senses, but the amount of skill and magical prowess necessary makes doing so a dangerous prospect. If even one participant fails to harness the Banality properly, the entire group risks chimerical death. If enough of the group can’t control the influx of Banality, they will all be Undone. The Bedlamite, meanwhile, has an equal chance of being unaffected or becoming Undone. Occasionally, a group’s failure can result in the changeling returning from Bedlam to find himself surrounded by dazed, confused mortals who look like his old friends, but such occurrences are rarer still than the ritual succeeding without a hitch. Bedlam Thresholds Unique to the situation that triggers them, Bedlam Thresholds should reflect the changeling’s mindset at the time. More Thresholds are listed on p. 294 of Changeling: The Dreaming 20th Anniversary Edition. Misguided Muse The very presence of a changeling caught up in their Imbalance exudes the Dreaming. Everyone in the immediate area finds Rapture, Reverie, and Revelry to be much easier; any and all attempts to determine a source of inspiration succeed instantly, with one exception. Anyone who botches an inspiration roll either inspires or succumbs to Rhapsody, depending on if they are targeting themselves or a Dreamer. Changelings caught up in Rhapsody lose contact with their fae selves for a number of days equal to their Banality ratings when their masterpiece is done; mortals suffer the same end as usual. Anyone inspired as a result of the Threshold reacts as though Ravaged when the process is complete. For changelings, they cannot attempt any path again for a number of days equal to their Glamour rating. Old Legends All changelings know the baleful touch of cold iron and the way it cuts them to the quick. However, it isn’t the only “old truth” about the fae, nor the only way to hurt or bind them. The closer a changeling slides toward Bedlam, the more the potency of those old legends returns to affect her as it affected her ancestors. Essentially, a changeling on the brink of Bedlam acquires the Echoes Flaw (Changeling: The Dreaming 20th, p.188) for the duration of her time spent on the threshold. Salt, certain herbs, and specific flowers (most notably primroses and Saint John’s wort) burn these changelings on contact, dealing a point of aggravated damage per round of contact. Other effects may bind these changelings as well — thrice-sworn statements are backed by the Dreaming as strongly as any oath, they find themselves unable to tell a direct lie, or they are drawn to certain fixtures and locations: offerings, or fae sites of old. While at first only one of these effects takes hold, and will only ever last as long as the Threshold, this particular Threshold can be activated multiple times, and its afflictions are cumulative. Past Life A changeling’s present existence is not only informed by his kith and kin – it is also informed by his past lives. When the Dreaming presses at the forefront of a changeling’s mind, he relives his past fae lives and can lose touch with his current reality in the rush. Unable to tell the past from the present, the changelings calls friends by other names, loses his ability to recall current powerful figures (in mortal or changeling society), and exhibits odd or outdated mannerisms. All attempts at Wits rolls increase in difficulty by 1 for each point of Imbalance the changeling has. For Arcadian sidhe, this Threshold may not manifest as past lives, but as memories from the bodies they acquired during the Resurgence or, if they are from more recent times, from the distant days of Arcadia. Uncanny Valley Although changelings inhabit human forms, mortals nevertheless retain the ability to pick out when things just aren’t right with them. The closer a changeling is to losing herself to her fae nature, the more the mortals around her notice that something is off. A redcap’s grin may appear too wide and too hungry; a piskie’s face may become unrecognizable, even to her closest friends; a sluagh’s soft voice weaves nightmares with the kindest words. People feel afraid, unnerved, or suspicious and have a hard time trusting the changeling affected by this Threshold. All Social rolls increase in difficulty by 1 for each point of Imbalance the changeling acquires. Unleashed Echoes Whether she’s Unleashed an Art recently or not, the presence of a changeling affected by this Threshold calls to the legend of her kith. She’s surrounded by the sights, scents, and sounds that normally accompany Unleashing. For the duration of the Threshold, all of her cantrips are Wyrd. She can direct them with a Realm as normal, and does not have to pay the extra Glamour cost for Wyrd cantrips; however, every Realm she pairs with her Art raises the difficulty of the cantrip by 1, as using her magic precisely becomes a greater challenge under such circumstances.
